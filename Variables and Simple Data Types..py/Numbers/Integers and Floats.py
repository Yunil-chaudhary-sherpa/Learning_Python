## THE CALCULATIONS ARE DONE IN TERMINAL SESSION

# Simple Calculations-

# Integers
#1. Addition
#   2+3  output = 5

#2. Subtraction
#   3-2  output = 1

#3. Multiplication
#   3*2  output = 6

#4. Division
#   24/3  output = 8

#5. Power
#   3**3  output = 9
# Spacing doesn't effect the result of the operation but can be used to make the program look more clean.

# Floats (Calculations are same from integers.)
# 0.1+0.1 output = 0.2
# 3.011201*7.01231 output = 21.115478843
