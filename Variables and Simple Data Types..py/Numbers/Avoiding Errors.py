# Avoiding Type Errors with str() Function-

age = 23
message = 'Happy'+age+"'rd Birthday"
print(message)
# Python doesn't recognize the type of information provided in age variable.
# As in 3rd row number 23 is a integer and in variable message the age is asked to be print as a string. Thus, when running the program the terminal will show an error.
