# GUIDELINES FOR A UNDRESTANDABLE PROGRAM 

# 1. Variable names can only have letters, numbers and underscores starting with a letter or underscore (not a number).
# 2. Spaces are not allowed in variable names.
# 3. Python key words and function names cannot be used as variable names.
# 4. Variable names should be short and well describing.
# 5. 'I' and '0' and be jumbled with 'l' and 'O'


# AVOIDING ERRORS WHILE USING VARIABLES

# Error generating code

message = 'Hello python crash course reader'
print(mesage) 
 # as the variable is wrong the program didn't execute
