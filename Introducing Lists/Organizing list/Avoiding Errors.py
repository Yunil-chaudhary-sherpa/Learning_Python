#  Index Error- 
# >While making a list in python most of the user make a simple mistake time and again;
names = [ 'Ram','Shyam','Hari']
print(names[3])
# This becomes an error because counting works differently in python. In a list the value is counted as 0 and not 1. So, in terminal the program above becomes invalid as no item is stored in 3 position.
